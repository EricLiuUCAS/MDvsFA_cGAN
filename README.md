# MDvsFA_cGAN

A tensorflow implementation of the MDvsFA_cGAN model which is proposed in ICCV2019 paper "Huan Wang, Luping Zhou, Lei Wang. Miss Detection vs. False Alarm: Adversarial Learing for Small Object Segmentation in Infrared Images".

File and folder description: 
1) The file demo_MDvsFA_release_v1.py is the only code file. Just run it as 'python demo_MDvsFA_release_v1.py'.  File Path and key parameters can be tuned in the file.
2) All generated model file and segmentation results will be saved in the folder 'trained model'.
3) The 'data' folder includes the training set in the folder 'training' and the test set in the folder 'test_org'(orginial images) and folder 'test_gt'(Ground truth).
